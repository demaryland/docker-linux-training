# 🎭 Module 5: Orchestrating the Show - Multi-Container Applications

*"Conducting your container orchestra with Docker Compose"*

Welcome to the world of container orchestration! Managing multiple containers manually with `docker run` commands gets complicated quickly. Docker Compose is your conductor's baton - it lets you define and manage multi-container applications with simple YAML files.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Write Docker Compose files for multi-container applications
- Orchestrate complex application stacks with ease
- Manage service dependencies and startup order
- Scale services up and down dynamically
- Configure networks and volumes declaratively
- Deploy applications across different environments
- Troubleshoot multi-container applications

## 🤔 Discussion Topics

After completing the labs, consider these questions:
1. How does Docker Compose simplify multi-container management?
2. What are the benefits and limitations of Compose vs other orchestration tools?
3. How do you handle secrets and sensitive configuration in Compose?
4. What strategies work best for zero-downtime deployments?

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Essential Compose Commands
```bash
# Application lifecycle
docker-compose up                    # Start all services
docker-compose up -d                 # Start in background
docker-compose down                  # Stop and remove services
docker-compose restart               # Restart all services

# Service management
docker-compose ps                    # List services
docker-compose logs                  # View all logs
docker-compose logs service_name     # View specific service logs
docker-compose exec service_name bash # Execute command in service

# Building and updating
docker-compose build                 # Build services
docker-compose pull                  # Pull service images
docker-compose up --build            # Build and start
```

### Basic Compose File Structure
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    depends_on:
      - api
    networks:
      - frontend

  api:
    build: ./api
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://db:5432/myapp
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - backend

volumes:
  db_data:

networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
```

## 🔍 Docker Compose Use Cases

### Development Environments
- Consistent development setup for entire team
- Easy onboarding for new developers
- Isolated development services
- Quick environment reset and cleanup

- Development and staging environments
- Legacy application modernization
- Microservices orchestration

### Learning and Experimentation
- Quick setup of complex software stacks
- Technology evaluation and prototyping
- Training environments
- Conference demos and workshops

## 🌟 Compose vs Manual Container Management

### Manual Approach (what you've been doing):
```bash
# Create network
docker network create myapp-net

# Start database
docker run -d --name db --network myapp-net \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=myapp \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
  -v db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres:13

# Start API
docker run -d --name api --network myapp-net \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://db:5432/myapp \
  myapp/api:latest

# Start web server
docker run -d --name web --network myapp-net \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx:alpine
```

### Docker Compose Approach:
```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

**Much simpler!** 🎉

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Head over to [Lesson 1: Introduction to Docker Compose](lessons/01-compose-basics.md) and let's start orchestrating your containers!

Remember: Docker Compose turns complex container management into simple, declarative configuration. You're about to become a container conductor! 🎼

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **YAML syntax errors?** Check indentation and structure carefully
- **Services won't start?** Check dependencies and startup order
- **Can't access services?** Verify port mappings and network configuration
- **Data not persisting?** Check volume definitions and mount points

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Start with simple compose files** and add complexity gradually
2. **Use meaningful service names** that reflect their purpose
3. **Always define networks explicitly** for better control
4. **Use environment files** for configuration management
5. **Test compose files** in development before production
