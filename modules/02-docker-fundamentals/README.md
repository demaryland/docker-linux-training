3. How might containers change the way your team deploys applications?

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Essential Docker Commands
```bash
# Container management
docker run [options] image          # Create and start a container
docker ps                          # List running containers
docker ps -a                       # List all containers
docker stop container_name         # Stop a running container
docker start container_name        # Start a stopped container
docker rm container_name           # Remove a container
docker logs container_name         # View container logs

# Image management
docker images                      # List local images
docker pull image_name            # Download an image
docker rmi image_name             # Remove an image
docker search keyword             # Search Docker Hub

# System information
docker version                    # Show Docker version
docker info                      # Show system information
docker system df                 # Show disk usage
```

### Common Docker Run Options
```bash
-d, --detach          # Run in background
-p, --publish         # Publish ports (host:container)
-e, --env             # Set environment variables
--name                # Assign a name to container
-v, --volume          # Mount volumes
-it                   # Interactive terminal
--rm                  # Remove container when it stops
```

## 🔍 Container Use Cases in IT Operations

### Web Applications
- Deploy web servers without complex setup
- Isolate applications from each other
- Easy scaling and load balancing

### Development Environments
- Consistent development environments
- Quick setup for new team members
- Test different software versions

### Microservices
- Break large applications into smaller services
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Better fault isolation

### Legacy Application Support
- Run older applications on modern systems
- Isolate dependencies
- Easier migration strategies

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Head over to [Lesson 1: Container Concepts](lessons/01-container-concepts.md) and let's begin your container journey!

Remember: Every container expert started with their first `docker run` command. You're about to join the container revolution! 🐳

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Docker not starting?** Check the troubleshooting guide in shared resources
- **Container won't run?** Use `docker logs container_name` to see what's happening
- **Port conflicts?** Use different port numbers or check what's already running
- **Permission issues?** Make sure your user is in the docker group

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Always check logs** when containers don't behave as expected
2. **Use meaningful names** for your containers with `--name`
3. **Clean up regularly** with `docker system prune` to free disk space
4. **Read the documentation** on Docker Hub for each image you use
5. **Start simple** and gradually add complexity

*"Containers are like LEGO blocks for applications - simple pieces that build amazing things!"* 🧱
