## 🤔 Discussion Topics

After completing the labs, consider these questions:
1. How do container security practices differ from traditional security?
2. What monitoring and alerting strategies work best for containers?
3. How do you balance security with operational efficiency?
4. What are the key considerations for container disaster recovery?

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Security Commands
```bash
# Image security
docker scan image:tag              # Scan image for vulnerabilities
docker history image:tag           # Review image layers
docker inspect image:tag           # Check image configuration

# Runtime security
docker run --read-only image       # Read-only filesystem
docker run --user 1000:1000 image # Run as non-root user
docker run --cap-drop ALL image   # Drop all capabilities
docker run --security-opt no-new-privileges image # Prevent privilege escalation
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Resource monitoring
docker stats                       # Live resource usage
docker system df                   # Disk usage
docker system events               # System events

# Health checks
docker inspect container | grep Health  # Check health status
docker logs --tail 100 container   # Recent logs
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Memory limits
docker run -m 512m image           # Limit memory to 512MB
docker run --oom-kill-disable image # Disable OOM killer

# CPU limits
docker run --cpus="1.5" image      # Limit to 1.5 CPUs
docker run --cpu-shares=512 image  # Relative CPU weight

# Combined limits
docker run -m 1g --cpus="2" --restart=unless-stopped image
```

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Head over to [Lesson 1: Container Security Fundamentals](lessons/01-security-fundamentals.md) and let's make your containers production-ready!

Remember: Production readiness isn't just about making things work - it's about making them work reliably, securely, and maintainably in the real world! 🌍

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Security concerns?** Start with official images and follow security best practices
- **Performance issues?** Monitor resource usage and optimize accordingly
- **Reliability problems?** Implement proper health checks and restart policies
- **Operational challenges?** Focus on automation and documentation

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Security first** - build security in from the beginning
2. **Monitor everything** - you can't manage what you can't measure
3. **Automate operations** - reduce human error and increase consistency
4. **Plan for failure** - things will go wrong, be prepared
5. **Document everything** - your future self will thank you

*"Production readiness is not a destination, it's a journey of continuous improvement!"* - Let's make your containers enterprise-grade! 🏢
